Desert locust plagues are still a threat to vegetation and agricultural lands in Africa and Asia as the recent outbreak in East Africa demonstrates. This is because it is a complex task to predict when and where desert locust will start breeding as this depends on several environmental conditions. Sentinel 1/2  and Landsat 8  satellite images do have high spacial resolution (10 x10 mÂ²) and temporal resolution  of 4 days.  The idea is that it should be possible to detect locust breeding areas at this resolution. Locust data from the Food And Agriculture Organization  are available to tag these data satellite images. Once tagged a neural network is to be build to identify potential breeding areas
